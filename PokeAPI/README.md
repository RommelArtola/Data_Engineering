📒 About This App
Developer Notes and Documentation

Welcome to the Pokédex Explorer
This app was built by Rommel Artola as a fun and interactive way to explore Pokémon data, and as a way to showcase some Data Engineering principles on the backend.

Features:
Filter Pokémon by stats, height, weight, type, and location
View official artwork and names
Data Source:
All data comes from PokeAPI, an open Pokémon RESTful API.
It has some minor transformations and is then uploaded to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase
The data is then queried and has some additional pivoting to get row-wise unique values
The data is then filtered given the selected filters, and the image is then shown.
